player
======

small video player based on Javascript and Html5.

The backend was made with RubyOnRails and the frontend in Javascript(Vanilla), my first incursion on Javascript and discovery Jasmine like a test platform. 

A too old project, there are a lot off security issues, but, sometime I will fix this issue.
